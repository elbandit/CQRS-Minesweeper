# INFO
## Overview
RoundhousE is an automated database deployment (change management) system that allows you to use your current idioms and gain much more. Currently it only supports Microsoft SQL Server, but there are future plans for other databases. 

It seeks to solve both maintenance concerns and ease of deployment. We follow some of the same idioms as other database management systems (SQL scripts), but we are different in that we think about future maintenance concerns. We want to always apply certain scripts (anything stateless like functions, views, stored procedures, and permissions), so we don’t have to throw everything into our change scripts. This seeks to solves future source control concerns. How sweet is it when you can version the database according to your current source control version? 

## Getting started with RoundhousE
### Downloads
 You can download RoundhousE from [http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/downloads/list](http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/downloads/list)  

 You can also obtain a copy from the build server at [http://teamcity.codebetter.com](http://teamcity.codebetter.com).  
  
### Gems  
If you have Ruby 1.8.6+ (and Gems 1.3.7+) installed, you can get the current release of RoundhousE to your machine the fastest!  
  
1. Type 'gem install roundhouse'  
2. Then from anywhere you can type 'rh <options>'  
  
### Source
This is the best way to get to the bleeding edge of what we are doing.  

1. Clone the source down to your machine.  
  `git clone git://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse.git`  
2. Type `cd roundhouse`  
3. Type `git config core.autocrlf false` to leave line endings as they are.  
4. Type `git status`. You should not see any files to change.
5. Run `build.bat`. NOTE: You must have git on the path (open a regular command line and type git).

* MSBuild / NAnt tasks are deprecated and no longer hooked up. Please use the console and call it from your tasks. (r268)
